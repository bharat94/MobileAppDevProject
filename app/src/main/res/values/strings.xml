    <string name="about_text">\
    This game is played just like
    regular Tic Tac Toe with one difference: to win a tile
    you have to win a smaller game of Tic Tac Toe inside that tile.\n\
    \n\
    A tie happens when there are no further moves.
    In the case of a tie in a small board, that will count as a win for
    both sides in the larger game.
