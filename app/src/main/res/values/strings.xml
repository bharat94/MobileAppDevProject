        <b>Hello!! </b>\n
    Welcome to Scroggle, a game for smart people.
        You would have to race against time to finish the game.\n\n
        <b>Phase 1 : </b>\n
        On a board, you have to play scrobble. In each of the 9 small grids, try to come up with a word as long as you can \n\n
        <b>Phase 2 : </b>\n
        Now that you are done with scrabble, its time to select some letters from the correct words that you made to go to the next phase of the game (Boggle!)\n\n

        <b>Phase 3 : </b>\n
        Aaaand! Its Boggle time! Now that you have scored a lot, you would play boggle from the letters that you selected. Try to maximize your points!
    </string>

    <string name="about_text">\
    This game is played just like
    regular Tic Tac Toe with one difference: to win a tile
    you have to win a smaller game of Tic Tac Toe inside that tile.\n\
    \n\
    A tie happens when there are no further moves.
    In the case of a tie in a small board, that will count as a win for
    both sides in the larger game.
